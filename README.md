Hey everyone !! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo is where Iâ€™ll be putting all my work from the **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship (Augâ€“Sept 2025)**.  

Itâ€™s a 4-week journey where Iâ€™ll be trying out different AI-related tasks, from simple chatbots to cool ML projects.  
Iâ€™ll keep adding my progress here as I complete each task.  

**I'm making this repo so that I can:**

-track my learning in AI  
-share clean, working code  
-look back and see how much Iâ€™ve improved
